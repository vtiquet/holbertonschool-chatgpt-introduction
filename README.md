# Holberton School - ChatGPT Introduction

[cite\_start]This repository contains a project from the Holberton School curriculum focused on **Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT**[cite: 2]. [cite\_start]The objective of these tasks was to leverage conversational AI to identify, debug, and improve various code samples written in Python, HTML, and JavaScript[cite: 2].

[cite\_start]The project emphasizes core development practices, including debugging logic, handling errors, and adding professional documentation[cite: 2].

## 📂 Project Structure

The main work is located in the `debugging` directory, which contains the following tasks:

| \# | Task | Objective | Files Included |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | [cite\_start]**Debugging - Python Factorial** [cite: 2] | [cite\_start]Fix an infinite loop in an iterative factorial function[cite: 6]. | [`factorial.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./debugging/factorial.py) |
| **1** | [cite\_start]**Debugging - Python Arguments** [cite: 2] | [cite\_start]Modify a script to print only command-line arguments, excluding the script name[cite: 10]. | [`print_arguments.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./debugging/print_arguments.py) |
| **2** | [cite\_start]**Debugging - HTML / Javascript** [cite: 3] | [cite\_start]Correct a DOM element ID mismatch to enable a button to change the background color[cite: 14, 18]. | [`change_background.html`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./debugging/change_background.html) |
| **3** | [cite\_start]**Debugging - Python Mines** [cite: 3] | [cite\_start]Implement a winning condition (detecting when all non-mine cells are revealed) in a Minesweeper game[cite: 30]. | [`mines.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./debugging/mines.py) |
| **4** | [cite\_start]**Documentation - Python Factorial** [cite: 4] | [cite\_start]Add a comprehensive docstring, including function description, parameters, and returns, to a recursive factorial function[cite: 33]. | [`factorial_recursive.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./debugging/factorial_recursive.py) |
| **5** | [cite\_start]**Error Handling - Python Checkbook** [cite: 4] | [cite\_start]Implement `try-except` blocks to prevent the checkbook program from crashing due to invalid, non-numeric input[cite: 38]. | [`checkbook.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./debugging/checkbook.py) |
| **6** | [cite\_start]**Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python** [cite: 5] | [cite\_start]Identify and correct multiple errors in the Tic-Tac-Toe game logic and input handling[cite: 43]. | [`tic.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=./debugging/tic.py) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any of the Python files, navigate to the `debugging` directory and execute them directly:

```bash
# Example for running a Python script
./debugging/factorial.py 5
# 120

# Example for running the Checkbook program
./debugging/checkbook.py
```
